    title: "Teaching and Supervision"
}

The following list describes the courses that I regularly teach. All courses were newly designed and taught by me in the Master’s program Creative Technologies, unless otherwise stated. There are several additional topics such as Artistic Thinking, Creative Thinking, Generative AI, Machine Learning, AI for Film Productions, Virtual Stage Theater, Virtual Production Techniques, and Media Design that I have taught in the past but which are not recurring courses.

I also supervise students for roughly one afternoon per week on their individual artistic and/or technical project work. These sessions include discussions about topics, artistic expression, research and development, and relevant technologies.

      <td><strong>Creative Coding I: Design & Communication</strong></td>
      <td>4 ECTS</td>
      <td>
        <p>
          The course introduces text-based programming as a tool for exploring design and communication across visuals, audio, text and data. Students work in a creative context investigating aesthetics, human experiences and insight, rather than practicality. As one of our main means of communication is the web, we use JavaScript, p5.js, and three.js.
        </p>

        <p><strong>Learning Objectives</strong>: Improve programming skills, strengthen conceptual and design abilities, gain foundational knowledge of web technologies, apply software development in a creative context, and implement specific design goals.</p>

        <p>
          This course introduces procedural and simulation algorithms for 2D and 3D graphics.
          Focus lies on patterns and abstract aesthetics. Topics include formal theories, practical
          implementations, and design perspectives. Unreal Engine 5 is the primary environment.
        </p>

        <p><strong>Learning Objectives</strong>: gain an overview of key techniques and their capabilities, understand underlying theories and algorithms, develop practical implementation skills, and translate concepts into specific design goals.</p>
