I have been reviewing for the ACM Transactions on Graphics, Computer Graphics Forum, Eurographics, ETRA, and CVMP. <br />
*As of now I am open to receiving new reviewing requests within my topic area.*
  
I have written numerous letters of reference for (faculty) positions, including tenure-track and full professorships.
